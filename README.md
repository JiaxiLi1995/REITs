# REITs

In this project, I will assist Professor Mike Aguilar and Professor Robert Connolly on the pricing of REIT. The primary task here is organizing and analyzing the data.

We try to price the equity REITS using existing factors. The REIT, stock and Factor data in this paper start from 1993. The return data here are log returns.

The first file here is called Cleaning.Rmd, in which I join all the data and convert all data into log return. I will also remove irrelevant data.

The second file here is called Betas.Rmd, in which I analyze the beta distributions for REIT and non-REIT.
