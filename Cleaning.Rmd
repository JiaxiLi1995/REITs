In this file, I first load all the data. After transforming simple returns into log returns, I remove the irrelevant variables and save all the data into a data file in the data folder.

# Load Data

```{r}
# load useful packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(dplyr)

# load the data and rename to make common names the same; only keep the REIT ones with share code 18 and exchange code above 0

Regular <- read_csv(here("data/Regular.csv"))

REIT <- readxl::read_xlsx(here("data/REIT.xlsx")) %>%
  # rename the variables as names in Regular
  rename(PERMNO = "CRSP Permanent Security Identifier",
         date = "Calendar Date",
         SHRCD = "Share Code",
         EXCHCD = "Exchange Code",
         RET = "Used Price Total Return...27",
         cap = "Market Capitalization",
         REITType = "REIT Type",
         PropertyType = "Property Type") %>%
  # keep share code = 18 and exchange code > 0
  filter(SHRCD == 18,
         EXCHCD > 0)

Factors <- read_csv(here("data/FF5.csv")) %>%
  # rename the date and Mkt_RF
  rename(date = "X1",
         Mkt_RF = "Mkt-RF") %>%
  # change all returns into decimals
  mutate_at(vars(-date), function(x, na.rm = FALSE) (x/100))
```


# Clean Regular Stocks

The selected "Regular" Stocks are the ones with share code 10 and 11.

```{r}
# Generate lagged capitalization for potential rebalancing and change date into yyyymm. Keep exchange code and share code. Note: RET is simple return.
Regular1 <- Regular %>%
  group_by(PERMNO) %>%
  mutate(date = floor(date/100),
         cap = abs(PRC) * SHROUT,
         lagcap = lag(cap, n = 1)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  subset(select = -c(5,7,8))
```

# Clean REIT Stocks

The selected "REIT" Stocks are the ones with share code 18.

```{r}
# Generate lagged capitalization for potential rebalancing and change date into yyyymm. Keep exchange code and share code. Note: RET is simple return.
REIT1 <- REIT %>%
  group_by(PERMNO) %>%
  # change date format
  mutate(date = gsub("[^[:digit:]]", "", date),
         date = floor(as.numeric(date)/100),
         lagcap = lag(cap, n = 1)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  subset(select = names(Regular1))
```

# Join all three dataset together

Join all data, remove non-existing returns

```{r}
# bind Regular1 and REIT1, then join Factors
All <- bind_rows(Regular1, REIT1) %>%
  inner_join(Factors) %>%
  # create risk premium RP (simple) and rp (log), and all log factors premium
  mutate(RP = RET - RF,
         rp = log(1 + RP),
         mkt_rf = log(1 + Mkt_RF),
         smb = log(1 + SMB),
         hml = log(1 + HML),
         rmw = log(1 + RMW),
         cma = log(1 + CMA),
         isREIT = (SHRCD == 18)) %>%
  # remove share code and exchange code
  subset(select = -c(3,4)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(rp))
```

# Verify the non-REITs

There are some equities are labeled both REITs and non-REITs. After investigating a few of them, it seems that CRSP first label the REITs as common stocks when it is just listed and then change it as REITs later. I would correct them here.

```{r}
# group PERMNO and isREIT and check those PERMNOs classified as both
All_1 <- All %>%
  group_by(PERMNO, isREIT) %>%
  summarise()

# check whether the PERMNOs are unique here (there are ones that is labeled both REITs and non-REITs)
Problems <- All_1 %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(PERMNO) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 1) %>%
  inner_join(All_1)

# It seems one with both labels are all REITs (I will trust the REITs data), and change all them to REITs
All <- All %>%
  mutate(isREIT = (isREIT|(PERMNO %in% Problems$PERMNO)))

# Remove duplicate ones
All <- All %>%
  unique()

# check whether there are only one PERMNOs (return) each day. For those with a problem, I would trust the CRSP data. I checked the CRSP data, and it seems the first ones are accurate.

All_2 <- All %>%
  group_by(PERMNO, date) %>%
  summarise()

Day_problem <- All %>%
  group_by(PERMNO, date) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 1) %>%
  inner_join(All)

# Remove the repeating ones that are inaccurate (even ones in Day_problem)
Day_problem1 <- Day_problem %>%
  subset(1:nrow(Day_problem) %in% seq(2,nrow(Day_problem), by = 2))

All_3 <- Day_problem1 %>%
  full_join(All)
All_3 <- All_3 %>%
  subset(is.na(n)) %>%
  subset(select = -3)

All_3 %>%
  group_by(isREIT) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

Then, I will extract a table with desired REITs Property types vs. PERMNO. We would want only equity REITs (REIT TYPE == 2) and leave out anything with a property type = 0, 1, 6, 7, or 8.  That gets us away from REITs where we donâ€™t know what they are actually doing (0 or 1), are mortgage REITs (6 or 7), or in residential (8) which is brand new or incredibly unusual.

```{r}
# Select Equity REIT and PropertyType 
Properties <- REIT %>%
  filter(REITType == 2,
         PropertyType %in% c(2:5,9,10)) %>%
  group_by(PERMNO, PropertyType) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

Prop <- Properties %>%
  subset(select = - n) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(PERMNO) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

# Remove the ones only appears once
Properties <- Properties %>%
  filter(!((n == 1) & (PERMNO %in% Prop$PERMNO))) %>%
  subset(select = - n)
```

Finally, we have matched 1,625,850 day&returns. There are 50,885 day&returns for REITs and 1,574,965 day&returns for non-REITs.

# Save all the data
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Save file as a csv
 write_csv(All_3, here("data","All.csv"))
 write_csv(Problems, here("data","Problems.csv"))
 write_csv(Day_problem, here("data","Day_problem.csv"))
 write_csv(Properties, here("data","Properties.csv"))
```
